    "A variable is a label that a computer uses to remember certain values or pieces of information. They are similiar to the variables that you would have seen in maths e.g. x=5. In programming, this is exactly the same idea, except computers can remember anything not just numbers, and additionally, the variables are generally given more meaningful names that relate to the data they contain e.g. \n",
