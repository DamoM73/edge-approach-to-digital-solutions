He would love nothing more than coming home each day and playing hangman to relax, but that would involve interacting with people. Mikey is looking for a way to play hangman by himself.\n",

    "Mikey is concerned that if he had hangman on his phone, that he would play it at work. Therefore he is looking for a solution that would only reside on his laptop. He knows that he can buy a hangman game, but he cannot afford it."
